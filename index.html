by central government, state governments
and local authorities (such as municipalities
and public corporations), with central
government accounting for the major portion
of such expenditure.</p>

It should not be spent for the benefit of a particular group of society. Public expenditure should result in increased production, elimination of inequality and promotion of welfare of all.</p>

                              <h2 class="animate__animated animate__flip">1. Principle of Maximum Social Benefit:</h2>
                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">It is necessary that all public expenditure should satisfy one fundamental test, viz., that of Maximum Social Advantage. That is, the government should discover and maintain an optimum level of public expenditure by balancing social benefits and social costs. Every rupee spent by a government must have as its aim the promotion of the maximum welfare of the society as a whole.</p> <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              Care has to be taken that public funds are not utilized for the benefit of a particular group or a section of society. The aim is the general welfare. Government exists for the benefit of the governed and the justification of the government expendi­ture is, therefore, to be sought in the benefit of the community as a whole.

                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              Although the aim of public expenditure is to maximize the social benefit, yet it does not exonerate government from exercising utmost economy in its expen­diture. Economy does not mean niggardliness. It only means that extra vagance and waste of all types should be avoided. Public expenditure has great poten­tially for public good but it may also prove injurious and wasteful. Thus, if revenue collected from the tax payer is heedlessly spent, it would be obviously uneconomical.
                             </p> <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               To satisfy the canon of economy, it will be necessary to avoid all duplication of expenditure and over-lappying of authorities. Further, public expenditure should not adversely affect saving. In case government activity damaged the individual’s will or power to save, it would go against the canon of economy.

                              <h2 class="animate__animated animate__flip">3. Canon of Sanction:</h2>
                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               Another important principle of public expenditnciple of public expenditure is that before it is actually incurred it should be sanctioned by a competent authority. Unauthorised spending is bound to lead to extravagance and over­spending. It also means that the amount must be spent on the purpose for which it was sanctioned.
                             </p> <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              Allied to the canon of sanction, there is another viz., auditing. Not only is previous sanction of public expenditure essential but apost-mordem examination is equally imperative. That is, all the public accounts at the end of the year should be properly audited to see that the amounts have not been misspent or misappropriated.

                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               Another sane principle of public expenditure is that it should be fairly elastic. It should be possible for public authority to vary the expenditure according to need or circumstances. A rigid level of expenditure may prove a source of trouble and embarrassment in bad times. Alteration in the upward direction in not difficult.
                             </p> <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              It is easy, rather tempting, to increase the scale of expenditure. But elasticity is needed tempting, to increase the scale of expen­diture. But elasticity is needed most in the downward direction. When the economy axe is applied it is a very painful process. Retrenchment of a wide­spread character creates serious social discontent.

A short spell of prosperity should not lead to long-term commitments. A fair degree of elasticity is essen­tial if financial breakdown is to be avoided at a time of shrinking revenue.

                                It is also necessary to ensure that public expenditure should exercise a healthy influence both on production and distribution of wealth in the community. It should stimulate productive activity so that income and employ­ment of the living. But this object of raising of living standards of the masses will be served only if wealth is evenly distributed. If newly created wealth goes to enrich the already rich, the purpose is not served. Public expenditure should aim at reducing the inequalities of wealth distribution.

                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               It is considered a sound or orthodox principle of public expenditure that as far as possible public expenditure should be kept well within the revenue of the State so that a surplus is left at the end of the year. In other words, the govern­ment should avoid deficit budget, But the modern economists, especially Keynes, do not regard surplus budgeting as a virtue, rather deficit budgeting is more useful in raising the levels of income and employment in the under­developed countries. All the same, budget deficits running over a series of years are considered bad for the financial stability of the country and they cause inflation which is injurious to the health of the economy.

                              Without government support and backing, a poor country cannot make huge investments to bring about a favourable change in the economic base of a country. That is why massive investments are made by the government in the development of basic and key industries, agriculture, consumable goods, etc.
                             </p>  <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                                Public expenditure has the expansionary effect on the growth of national income, employment opportunities, etc. Economic development also requires development of economic infrastructures. A developing country like India must undertake various projects, like road-bridge-dam construction, power plants, transport and communications, etc.
                             </p>
                              <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               These social overhead capital or economic infrastructures are of crucial importance for accelerating the pace of economic development. It is to be remembered here that private investors are incapable of making such massive investments on the various infrastructural projects. It is imperative that the government undertakes such projects. Greater the public expenditure, higher is the level of economic development.

                             <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               Public expenditure is considered as an important tool of fiscal policy. Public expenditure creates and increases the scope of employment opportunities during depression. Thus, public expenditure can prevent periodic cyclical fluctuations. During depression, it is recommended that there should be more and more governmental expenditures on the ground that it creates jobs and incomes.
                             </p>  <br>
                             <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              On the contrary, a cut-back in government’s expenditure is necessary when the economy faces the problem of inflation. That is why it is said that by manipulating public expenditure, cyclical fluctuations can be lessened greatly. In other words, variation of public expenditure is a part of the anti- cyclical fiscal policy.
                             </p>
                              <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                                It is to be kept in mind that it is not just the amount of public expenditure that is incurred which is of importance to the economy. What is equally, if not more, important is the purpose of such expenditure or the quality of expenditure. The quality of expenditure determines the adequacy and effectiveness of such expenditure. Excessive expenditures may cause inflation.
                             </p>
                             <p class="content content-3 mb-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                              Moreover, if the government has to impose taxes at high rates there will be loss of incentives. So, it is necessary to avoid unnecessary expenditure as far as practicable, otherwise benefits of better economic development may not be reaped. As a fiscal policy instrument, it may be counter-productive.

                               Public expenditure is used as a powerful fiscal instrument to bring about an equitable distribution of income and wealth. There are good much public expenditure that benefit poor income groups. By providing subsidies, free education and health care facilities to the poor people, government can improve the economic position of these people.

                              Public expenditure can correct regional disparities. By diverting resources in backward regions, government can bring about all-round development there so as to compete with the advanced regions of the country.
                             </p>  <br>
                                 <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                               This is what is required to maintain integration and unity among people of all the regions. Unbalanced regional growth encourages disintegrating forces to rise. Public expenditure is an antidote for these reactionary elements.
                             </p>  
                              <p class="content content-3 my-4 animate__fadeInDown animate__animated">
                                Thus, public expenditure has both economic and social objectives. It is necessary to ensure that the government’s expenditure is made solely in the public interest and does not serve any individual’s interest or that of any political party or a group of persons.
